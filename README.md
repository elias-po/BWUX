# Better Windows User eXperience

Coming from say a laptop running macOS with all it's gestures and shortcuts to a Windows dektop with a single screen may make interacting with the OS feel harder than it should be. Set of measures collected here strives to solve this problem.

### AutoHotkey scripts
[main.ahk](ahk/main.ahk) adds gesture replacements in a form of shortcuts plus more shortcuts familiar to macOS users

### Applications
Apps that make routine actions more convenient and/or take less clicks to perform.

Short list:
* [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
* [QuickLook](https://pooi.moe/QuickLook/)
* [EarTrumpet](https://github.com/File-New-Project/EarTrumpet)
* [Wox Launcher](http://www.wox.one/)
